# Databricks Handler

This is the implementation of the Databricks handler for MindsDB.

## Databricks
A data lakehouse unifies the best of data warehouses and data lakes in one simple platform to handle all your data, analytics and AI use cases. Itâ€™s built on an open and reliable data foundation that efficiently handles all data types and applies one common security and governance approach across all of your data and cloud platforms.<br>

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the `databricks-sql-connector`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on Databricks clusters and Databricks SQL warehouses.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `server_hostname`: the server hostname for the cluster or SQL warehouse
* `http_path`: the HTTP path of the cluster or SQL warehouse
* `access_token`: a Databricks personal access token for the workspace for the cluster or SQL warehouse

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well,
* `session_configuration`: a dictionary of Spark session configuration parameters
* `http_headers`: additional (key, value) pairs to set in HTTP headers on every RPC request the client makes
* `catalog`: catalog to use for the connection. If left blank, the default catalog, typically `hive_metastore` will be used
* `schema`: schema (database) to use for the connection. If left blank, the default schema `default` will be used

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to Databricks in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE databricks_datasource
WITH
engine='databricks',
parameters={
    "server_hostname": "adb-1234567890123456.7.azuredatabricks.net",
    "http_path": "sql/protocolv1/o/1234567890123456/1234-567890-test123",
    "access_token": "dapi1234567890ab1cde2f3ab456c7d89efa",
    "schema": "example_db"
};
~~~~

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,
~~~~sql
SELECT * FROM databricks_datasource.example_tbl
