There are two types of integrations to MindsDB.

 - <strong> [Data Sources](/datasources/overview) </strong> These are all the data sources that you can plug to MindsDB, including traditional databases and data that is behind APIs. It is important that MindsDB does no ETL pipelines. When you query a data source MindsDB forwards this query in real-time to the original data source. MindsDB is very good at translating SQL to any other query dialect.
 - <strong> [AI Engines](/ai-engines/overview) </strong> These are all the possibilities you have for AI/ML Modeling, from Generative AI to traditional ML and Auto-ML.

<Tip>
If you want to use a specific integration with MindsDB (either data or AI/ML integration), you need to ensure that the required dependencies are installed.

You can verify it by running this command:

```sql
SHOW HANDLERS WHERE name = 'integration_name';
```

The output includes the `IMPORT_SUCCESS` column. If this column reads `true`, then you can go ahead and use this integration. But, if it reads `false`, then you need to install all required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).
