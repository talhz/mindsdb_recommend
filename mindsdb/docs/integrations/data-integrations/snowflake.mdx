This is the implementation of the Snowflake data handler for MindsDB.

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is a cloud data warehouse that stores and analyzes data. It can automatically scale up/down its compute resources to load, integrate, and analyze data.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB [locally via Docker](https://docs.mindsdb.com/setup/self-hosted/docker) or use [MindsDB Cloud](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/).
2. To connect Snowflake to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).

<Tip>
Please note that, if you are using Docker to run MindsDB, before installing the dependencies for this integration as per the instructions given above, it is currently necessary to install Git in the container. To do this, run the following commands:

Start an interactive shell in the container:
```bash
docker exec -it mindsdb_container sh
```
If you haven't specified a name when spinning up the MindsDB container with `docker run`, you can find it by running `docker ps`.

Install Git:
```bash
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install git
``` 

The need to perform this step will be removed in future versions of MindsDB.

3. Install or ensure access to Snowflake.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the Snowflake connector.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `host` is the host name or IP address. The host name comes from the Snowflake link (for example, `uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com`).
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name. You can find it in the Snowflake dashboard under the Databases tab.
* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `account` is the Snowflake account. The account name comes from the Snowflake link (for example, `uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp`).
* `schema` is the default schema name used to query the database.
* `protocol` is the protocol that defaults to `https` if left blank.
* `warehouse` is the warehouse account. You can find it in the Snowflake dashboard under the Warehouses tab.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the Snowflake database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE snowflake_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'snowflake',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com",
    "port": 443,
    "database": "database_name",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password",
    "account": "uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp",
    "schema": "schema_name",
    "protocol": "https",
    "warehouse": "warehouse_name"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.example_table;
```

Please note that the above query uses the provided schema implicitly so it is equivalent to the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.schema_name.example_table;
```

If you have access to other schemas available in the connected Snowflake database, then you can query them as below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.other_schema_name.example_table;
```
