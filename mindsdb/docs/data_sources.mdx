MindsDB provides various [data and application handlers](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers) that let you connect any data source and make use of your data to finetune models or make predictions. The types of data sources include databases, vector stores, and applications.

<Tip>
MindsDB integrates with numerous data sources. [Learn more here](/integrations/data-overview).
</Tip>

You can connect a data source to MindsDB with the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/mindsdb_sql/sql/create/database) statement by providing connection parameters specific to the data source.

Please note that MindsDB does not store or copy your data. Instead, it utilizes the connection created with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement to access your data when required.
