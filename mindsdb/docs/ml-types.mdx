MindsDB offers four ways you can do machine learning:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Time Series
- Classification
- Regression

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language.

Learn more about NLP [here](/nlp/what-is-nlp) and check out the examples!

## Time Series

Time series models fall under the regression or classification category. But whatâ€™s distinct about them is that we order data by date, time, or any value defining sequential order of events. Usually, predictions made by time series models are referred to as *forecasts*.

## Classification

Classification is a type of predictive modeling that analyses input data, including relationships between dependent and independent variables and the target variable that is to be predicted. In the case of classification models, the target variable belongs to a set of discrete values.

## Regression

Regression is a type of predictive modeling that analyses input data, including relationships between dependent and independent variables and the target variable that is to be predicted. In the case of regression models, the target variable belongs to a set of continuous values.
