Generally speaking, MindsDB SQL attempts to follow the syntax conventions of MySQL and PostgreSQL. The following
sections describe some common conventions of MindsDB SQL.


## Single/Double Quotes & Backticks

Identifiers (databases, tables, and column names) with special characters or reserved words must use the backtick
"`":

```sql
SELECT * FROM `select` WHERE `select`.id > 100;

SELECT * FROM `select-DATABASE` WHERE `select-DATABASE`.id > 100;
```

String values are represented by single and double quotes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE table_name.column_name = 'string';
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE table_name.column_name = "string";
```

## Parentheses

SQL statements can be nested with parentheses:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE table_name.column_name = 'string') ;

```
