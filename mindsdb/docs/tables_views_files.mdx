Tables, views, and files store data. Let's go over these concepts.

In MindsDB, you can create tables in the connected databases, assuming the user used to connect this database to MindsDB has a write access. To do that, we provide the customized `CREATE TABLE` statement so you can create a table based on a `SELECT` query that fetched the predictions.

Another way to save your predictions in MindsDB is to create views. Similarly to creating tables but here we use the customized `CREATE VIEW` statement. Please note that views, as opposed to tables, are stored in projects within MindsDB.

MindsDB lets you upload files, including CSV, XLSX, and JSON files, so you can utilize data stored in these files as like as any other table data.
