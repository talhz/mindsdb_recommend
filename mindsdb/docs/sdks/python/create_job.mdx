## Description

The `get_job()` and `create_job()` functions let you save either an existing job or a newly created job into a variable.

## Syntax

Use the `get_job()` method to get an existing job:

```bash
my_job = project.get_job('my_job')
```

Or, the `create_job()` method to create a job:

```bash
my_job = project.create_job(
    'job_name',
    'select * from models',
    repeat_str = '1 hour'
)
```
